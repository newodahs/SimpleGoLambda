# For deploying to AWS

I used a simple S3 static host deployment for this as it's a pretty simple project. To do this:
 1. setup an S3 bucket with public access turned on
 2. execute `npm run build` from the `exploited-creds-ui` directory
 3. upload the files from `build/` and `build/static` to the bucket
 4. turn on static website hosting for the S3 bucket and note the url

I did not mess with cloudfront or DNS for this test, however, to further enhance this we could do a cloudfront deployment, setup propper dns, configure a proper WAF, etc...

# Running locally
Aside from `npm start`, you may also want to edit `src/App.js` around lines 22-23 to point the instance at a local dynamodb (if you're running a local dynamodb instance):
```
// uncomment this line for local access and comment out the following line
// const response = await axios.get(`http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/compromised?filter=${searchInput}`);

const response = await axios.get(`https://d08c84xwb6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/compromised?filter=${searchInput}`);
```
