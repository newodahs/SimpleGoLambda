# For Local DynamoDB testing ONLY

This is a simple docker compose to pull AWS' official dynamodb docker image for local running only.

I like to have a local test harness so I don't have to keep going to the cloud all the time to test quick changes, so this enables that.

See the Amazon documentation for more details: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html
